## To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do app built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to manage their tasks by performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). You can use the app to manage your tasks by adding, editing, and deleting tasks as needed. Your tasks will be saved in the browser's local storage, so you can close the app and reopen it later to resume your task management.

### Features

- Create Task: Users can add new tasks by entering a task description and pressing the "Add Task" button.
- Read Task: The app displays a list of all the tasks that have been added. Each task is shown with its description and a checkbox indicating its completion status.
- Update Task: Users can edit the description of a task by clicking on the task's description and modifying it inline. Pressing Enter or clicking outside the input field saves the changes.
- Delete Task: Users can delete a task by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the task.
- Persistence: The app uses the browser's local storage to persist the tasks, allowing the user to close and reopen the app without losing their tasks.
